    <h1>Welcome to the Anno&nbsp;Designer!</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      This is a web version of the building layout designer for Ubisofts Anno-Series.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aim is simple: Do everything the original Anno Designer did, but do it better while adding some cool stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is, just like the original Anno Designer, totally open source and will be free for everyone forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of obvious technical reasons this web version requires you to create a user account if you want to create and edit layouts.
      For unregistered users the whole page is read-only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advantages over the original Anno Designer:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provides a quickly searchable layout list, showing you just the layouts matching your requirements.
        <small class="text-muted">I'm still working on the "searchable" part here ;)</small></li>
      <li>Bringing it to the web makes it accessible to different platforms and devices.</li>
      <li>Totally removes all the work required for exporting, editing and uploading the layout images.</li>
      <li>Layouts are not stored as static images but instead are rendered on-the-fly,
        enabling all layouts to be improved by later updates to the rendering.</li>
      <li>Not bound to any specific game because the building icons and properties can be updated any time.</li>
    </ul>
